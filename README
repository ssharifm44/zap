Acknowledgements:  

     I would like to thank Milod and all of the TA's. I probably worked with
     half of the TA's for cs15 so I just want to thank everyone for helping
     me learn and build this program. This was a great learning expereince
     for me. Specifically, I would like to thank my OH TA's Dameli and Luke
     who I have learned so much from. 

Files: 

     phaseOne.cpp

          This is implementation of my frequency counter, my serializer and my
          deserializer. 

     phaseOne.h

          This is the interface of my functions mentioned above. 

     unit_tests.h

          This is where my unit testing takes place that I tested all of my 
          phaseOne functions for this submission. I tested that I was 
          serializing and encoding correctly in my phase one functions. 

     HuffmanTreeNode.h

          This was a given file for the interface of the HuffmanTreeNode class.
          this file gives me the ability to make a huffman tree and modify it.

     main.cpp

          This is my local main file. For phase one, i didn't end up utalizing
          this. For phase two, I just make an instance of Huffman

     MakeFile

          this is my makeFile that compiles, provides and cleans this program

     HuffmanCoder.cpp

          Huffmancoder is the week two phase of this project. This file runs a
          command line, opens/closes files, and saved compressed/decompresssed
          files. This is the implementation of the functionality of the encoder
          and decoder. 

     HuffmanCoder.h

          This is the interface of the functions required for encoding and 
          decoding. This class is essentially the entire zap program with some
          functions included from phaseOne.cpp

     BinaryIO.h

          This is a provided class that has many capabilities. Reading and 
          and writing to files primarily. 

     all_conll_english.txt

          This is a provided testing files. I used this in the diff test 
          process. This is useful for seeing if my program was fast enough 
          because the file is so big. 

     banana_apple.txt

          Another provided test file. Very straight forward test for the diff
          test process. 

     ecoli.coli

          Similiarly to all_conll_english.txt, this file is a large file that
          is great for diff tests and seeing if your program has fast enough
          run time. 

     emptyFile.txt

          This was a file that I created to see if my program is capable of 
          handling the edge case where the file is empty. 

     hi.txt

          Another provided test file. Very straight forward test for the diff
          test process. 

     newOutput.txt

          this was the file that my ./zap program was writing to after encoding
          in the diff test process. 

     referenceOutput.txt

          This was the file that ./the_zap was writing to after encoding during
          the diff test process. 

     refunzapOutput.txt

          This was the file that ./the_zap was writing to after decoding during
          diff test process. 

     sentences.txt

          Another provided test file. Very straight forward test for the diff
          test process. 
     
     test.txt

          This was the first test that I made for encoding testing. I wanted to
          make the tree that was in the spec so this test is designed to 
          that tree. 

     unzapOutput.txt

          This was the file that ./zap was writing to after decoding during
          the diff test process. 

     works_of_shakespear.txt

          This is a provided testing files. I used this in the diff test 
          process. This is useful for seeing if my program was fast enough 
          because the file is so big. 

Data Structures:

      Queue:

          Argueably the most important data structure in this program is the
          Priority Queue. A Priority Queue is a queue that has weights in the
          organization of the nodes. The priority queue is being organized by
          a min heap in the background, but the priority queue still funcitions
          as a queue under the hood. This was the perfect data 
          structure for this program because it is naturually capable of 
          building Binary trees which is purpose of the priority queue in this
          program. The prioroity queue is naturally capable of building 
          binary trees because it pushes out the lowest frequency nodes first,
          which makes the higher frequency nodes at the top of the tree and
          lower frequency nodes at the bottom of the tree - just how a binary
          tree should be built. Becuase a queue is essentially a linked list
          under the hood, there is O(1) run time for insertion and deletion. 
          This is fantastic for this program because adding/deleting from the
          tree is the primary usage of the program in this project. I had to 
          keep run time in mind so it is fantastic that there was O(1) run
          time. With this being said, the min heap feature of the queue had
          O(log n) run time which I will discuss more later. 

      Array:

          Another data structure use in this program is an array. These arrays
          found in the forms of vectors in this program. The primary purpose of
          these vectors is to store binary pathes, characture frequencies and 
          storing strings typed into the command line. The vector/array is the 
          perfect data struture for this program because of it's O(1) runtime
          for accessing data in an array. Speed was a priority in this program
          and so that was a great data structure to use. Another great reason
          I used vectors/arrays was because you can easily abstact the
          organizaition of data within the array. An example of this in the 
          program was when I was storing the frequency of different ascii 
          chars. Because ascii chars are really just ints under the hood, I 
          just increased the number inside the corrosponding integer value of
          each char. Another feature of the vector that was really nice to work
          with was the fact that I knew it was dynamic so I never had to worry
          about it being too small. With that being said, I don't think my 
          vector ever would have had to expand because I allocated 256 spaces -
          the same number of spaces for each ascii character, but if my vector
          had to expand, that would have been one of the more costly runtimes
          to copy allocate a new vector and copy over the contents of my data
          stored in that vector. 

      BinaryTree:

          Another hugely important data structure that was used during this 
          program is a binary tree. This was used because Huffman Trees are
          an efficient algorithm for compressing and decompressing data. As I 
          am sure that you are aware, a huffman tree is a binary tree that is 
          organized based on the frequencies of chars. The binary tree is the
          perfect data structure for this project becuase the Huffman Coder 
          algorithm is capable of organizing the data of a file in a way that
          takes significanly less bits then previously required. This is 
          essentially the entire purpose of this program. Not only the fact 
          that the binary tree was part of what made this program capable of 
          lossy compression, the accociated runtimes with adding/removing nodes
          from the tree is O(1) which is perfect because this program had to 
          be congnisant of run time efficiency. Another part of the program 
          where this came into play was when the program was terminating, I 
          had to call deleteTree() to free all the data in the tree in order
          to avoid memory leak issues. 

          The other implementation of binary tree was used for building the 
          priority queue. There is a min heap function used that builds a
          binary tree where the lowest value node is the root of the tree and
          as you move down the tree, the values become larger. This design is
          makes the priority queue work. Similarly to many of the features 
          mentioned above, insertion and deletion for min heap is O(log n)
          which is relatively fast. 
    

Algorithm Overview: 

      A couple of the algorithms that are most relied on in this program: 
          
          stringDecoder()

          This was one of the most complicated algorithms just because of the
          time complexity involved. To give you a run down the function, I 
          amout reconstrucing the text data that was origninally plugged into 
          the zap fuction. In other words. I am de-compressing the data after 
          compressing the data. I do this by staring at the root of the tree
          and depending if the program encoungers a 1 or a 0. If a 1 is 
          encountered the program traverses to the right node down the tree.
          If a 0 is encountered, the program will traverse left down the tree.
          Meanwhile, there is an if function that checks if the root is at a
          leaf. If it is, then the root pointer gets reset back to the root of
          the tree as well as appends the data value in the leaf node to an 
          already declared string. An important part of this algorithm is to 
          check to see if the function reached the end of a binary string while
          not at a leaf node. The first time I made this function, I did it
          recursively. This functioned accurately, but it was slow. For big 
          files, the program would get "killed" which is essentially timing
          out. I had to rebuild this function using a while loop which turned 
          out to be significanly faster. This was my first experience where I 
          really had to consider time complexity in my programming. 

          deserialize_helper() & deserialize_tree()

          deserialize_tree is a funciton that generates a binary tree based off
          of a serialized string that represents the organization of a binary
          tree. This is a recursive function that uses the trampoline function
          deserialize_helper() to perform that recursion. deserialize_helper 
          contains most of the funcitonality of this program. To give you a run
          down of this function, this program builds a tree by reading in a 
          serialized string. If the char is an 'I', the program makes an 
          internal huffman node with a null stored in its data value. From
          here, the program moves to the left and right childnode and recalls
          deserialize_helper to make those nodes as well. If 'L' is read in, 
          the program knows to make a leaf node. The program starts by making
          a node with the char value found after the 'L' that was originally 
          read in. One of the unique aspects of this function is how it 
          traverses the string that was read in. This funciton traverses by 
          using substr() to incrementally decrease the size of the string that
          was read in. This allows the program to evenaully read in the whole
          string. 

          build_tree()

          The last algorithm that I think is important to discuss is the 
          build_tree() function. This function is enormously important because
          it is part of the core competency of the decompression in this 
          program. To give a high level over view of this algorithm, it starts
          by making a node with its corrosponding data value and frequency.
          From here, the algorithm pushes all of those nodes into the priority
          queue. As mentioned previously, the design of the priority queue is
          perfect for constructing Huffman trees becuase lowest frequency nodes
          have the highest priority and get made into leaves of the tree first.
          Once build tree made all of the nodes, it pushed them all back onto 
          the priority queue. From here, the queue began to make internal nodes
          by combining the leaf nodes. These internal nodes would then be 
          pushed back on the priority queue. This process happened until a full
          Huffman tree was build with only the root of the tree remaining in
          the queue. The program then returns the root of the tree so that
          other functions then have access to the whole tree. 



Testing:

   count_freq_test() 

     This is the test provided in the spec to test my count frequency function.

   count_freq_whiteSpace()

     This was used to test my count frequency. I tested that it would work with
     lots of white spaces. 

   count_freq_TwoWords() 

     This was used to test my count frequency. I tested that it would work with
     white spaces and chars.

   count_CapVsLowerCase()

     This was used to test my count frequency. I tested that it would work with
     capital vs. lower case chars

   count_LongStressTest()  

     This was used to test my count frequency. I tested that it would work with
     all differnt ascii values

   count_newLine() 

     This was used to test my count frequency. I tested that it would work with
     new lines

   count_SpecExample()

     This is the test provided in the spec to test my count frequency function. 

   testTree()

     This was the tree provided in the spec. I tested that my serialize tree 
     worked against the provided tree and string in the spec. 

   testTreeTwo()

     This was another random tree that I made to test my serialize tree
     function

   test_deserialize()

     This was a test that I ran to ensure that my deserilize three funciton 
     works. This test was built from the random second tree that I built for 
     testing.

    I am beginning to test my encoder functions now after having to handle a 
    nightmare makefile situation. I ended up accidntally removing BinaryIO.o
    and had to redownload it. 

   void test_buildTree()

    This test was built to test that I was properly building a tree. I have a
    cout inside of my count frequencies function and inside of my buidl tree 
    funciton so that it prints out the values and frequencies. 

   void test_encoder()

    This test was built to test my encoder. I inputted "BaNana" into the 
    encoder and out came the binary strings for each char. The following
    is what print into terminal. 

      a: 0
      n: 10
      B: 110
      N: 111
      ILaILnILBLN

   void test_encoder_tw0Characters()

    In this test, I did the same as above, but I only tested with a string of 
    size two. "xo" was my inputted string. The following is what was printed
    out for the pathes of each string which makes sense. 

    o: 0
    x: 1
    ILoLx 


  void specTestEncoder()

    For this test, I inputted "aaaaabbbbbfffcdeee" which should produce the
    same tree and binary codings as the spec. 

    These were the pathes that were outputted from the test. I am confused by
    this. It seems to me that the frequencies are not matching up. I am going
    to ask about this in office hours. It seems to me that 'a' should be the
    left most node but it isn't here. 
    01 01 01 01 01 10 10 10 10 10 111 111 111 1100 1101 00 00 00
    e: 00
    a: 01
    b: 10
    c: 1100
    d: 1101
    f: 111
    IILeLaILbIILcLdLf

    I made three encoder function that are not working. It is throwing a
    runtimer error that says "unable to open file." After consulting a TA, I
    learned that this is okay since my program isn't being tested in main where
    I have to build the functionality to open a program. I think from here on
    out I will be diff testing. 
  
    Okay so I went to office hours and it was explained to me that I do not
    have to have the same exact tree as the spec and that there are many 
    different valid trees so I am not worried about my output above. It seems
    to be functioning perfeclty fine to me. 

    test.txt

    "aaaaabbbbbfffcdeee" - This is the string stored in the test.txt file. 
    I compared this to the_zap and my output is different. I need to 
    reconfigure my encoder.

    Okay So I just had a major break through. The number of bits that my 
    encoder function was making was different than the reference encoder. I got
    to the bottom of this by figuring out that my binary string function was
    broken. This was broken because my string stream had to be reset. I had
    no idea that this was a thing but now I know.

    else

    vm-hw00{smille28}58: ./the_zap zap test.txt testOutput.txt
    Success! Encoded given text using 43 bits.
    
    Above is the output that I get when I run zap. SO FIRED UP! My number of 
    bits matches the reference's bits. This looks like a valid Binary string,
    serialized string and proper individual pathes. This is very good news. 
    I will continue testing from here. 

    Okay so I just debugged a pretty cool thing. My run function, which 
    runs the command line and calls encoder and decoder wasn't working with
    argv[1] == "zap"
    This was giving me an error saying that I couldn't compare string literals. 
    I found on stackoverflow the way around this issue. 
    strcmp(argv[1],"zap") == 0. If this is satasfied, I call encoder and this
    has been working so that is great. 

    vm-hw01{smille28}180: ./Zap zap banana.txt testOutput.txt

    Success! Encoded given text using 11 bits.
    vm-hw01{smille28}182: diff testOutput.txt reftestOutput.txt

    This was my first file that I diffed!! I zapped the bannana file and diffed
    it against my zap funciton. No differences so this is great. 

    vm-hw05{smille28}61: ./Zap unzap testOutput.txt unzapOutput.txt

    So I ran another diff test where I am testing to see if my unzap is working
    properly. It appears to me that I am stopping one character short. 

    vm-hw05{smille28}81: ./Zap zap sentences.txt testOutput.txt

    Okay so I just ran another diff test. It appears to have the same problem
    where my unzap is running one character short.

    vm-hw07{smille28}60: ./Zap unzap testOutput.txt unzapOutput.txt
    Killed

    Okay so I have some other problems as well. My program is taking way too 
    long to run so it is killing my program. 

    I reconfigured my enoder function to use a while loop instead of recursion.
    I learned in office hours that recurssion takes significanly longer and So
    I did that. This took care of my stopping too short problem and the runtime
    of my program. 

    vm-hw07{smille28}119: ./Zap zap ecoli.coli testOutput.txt

    vm-hw07{smille28}123: diff unzapOutput.txt refunzapOutput.txt

    I just zapped and unzapped ecoli and there were no differences. 

    I still have some runtime errors to take care of.

    Okay I was just able to implement a runtime error that states that the 
    encoding did not match. I was having troubl with this but the above shows 
    that I was able to diff test with it. 

    vm-hw09{smille28}67: ./the_zap zap works_of_shakespeare reftestOutput.txt
    terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
      what():  Unable to open file works_of_shakespeare
    Abort (core dumped)
    vm-hw09{smille28}68: ./the_zap zap works_of_shakespeare.txt
                         reftestOutput.txt
    Success! Encoded given text using 25258000 bits.

    terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
      what():  Unable to open file

    I just ran a test to see if my program threw the right error if the a file
    couldn't be opened. It did not. Will have to reconfigure this.
    
    vm-hw09{smille28}71: ./Zap zap works_of_shakespeare.tx testOutput.txt
    terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
    what():  Unable to open file works_of_shakespeare.tx

    Fixed it.

    I just diff tested the works of shakespear with no errors. I am beginning
    to feel confidenct that my program works very well. 

    I still have valgrind errors in my unzap program. I will now address that.

    Actually, scratch that. I think my deconstructor is working actually. 
    Here is the proof:

    I just tested that my program is able to throw the appropriate error when
    the input file is empty.

    I just diff tested all_conll_english.txt which is a pretty large file. 
    Great news. Great read as well.

    I reconfigued parts of my program to get rid some warnings. I am now using
    a vector instead of an array so my warnings went away. Above I diff tested
    with valgrind to make sure my program is working right. 
    
    The only problem I know that I still have is valgrind with throwing errors. 
    Also, at this point. I know that I have a 47 out of 50 on autograder. 
    One of the test that I failed was an incorrect command line which I fixed
    right away. So I'm pretty sure I'm at a 48/50. 

    Okay so I ran some more tests. I diff tested with MobyDick.txt, 
    captainUnderPants.txt and the bible.txt. I have diff tested with all of the
    provided testing files aswell. I just ran the Auto Grader and I got a 
    49/50. I am confident that my progam works besides for the small valgrind
    problem that I couldln't get to the bottom of. 

    I am trying to submit right now and most of the test files that I made are
    too large so I cannot submit them. 


Hours Spent: 

    I spent around 10 hours on this assignment. 

    Thank you for reading. Please go easy on me. 
    
    Best,
