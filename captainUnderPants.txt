CHAPTER I 

GCOAGE AMD HAAOLD 


Meet George Beard and Harold Hutchins, 
George is the kid on the left with the tie 
and the flat-top. Harold is the one on the 
right with the T-shirt and the bad haircut. 
Remember that now. 





George and Harold were best friends. 
They had a lot in common. They lived 
right next door to each other and they 
were both in the same fourth-grade class 
at Jerome Horwitz Elementary School. 

George and Harold were usually 
responsible kids. Whenever anything bad 
happened, George and Harold were 
usually responsible.

But don’t get the wrong idea about 
these two. George and Harold were 
actually very nice boys. No matter what 
everybody else thought, they were good, 
sweet, and lovable. . . . Well, OK, maybe 
they weren’t so sweet and lovable, but 
they were good nonetheless. 





c 

( 


It’s just that George and Harold each 
had a “silly streak” a mile long. Usually 
that silly streak was hard to control. 
Sometimes it got them into trouble. And 
once it got them into big, BIG trouble. 

But before I can tell you that story, I 
have to tell you this story. 







vAy Ay 




CHAPTEA 1 




After a hard day of cracking jokes, pulling 
pranks, and causing mayhem at school, 
George and Harold liked to rush to the 
old tree house in George’s backyard. 
Inside the tree house were two big old 
fluffy chairs, a table, a cupboard crammed 
with junk food, and a padlocked crate 
filled with pencils, pens, and stacks and 
stacks of paper.

Now, Harold loved to draw, and George 
loved to make up stories. And together, 
the two boys spent hours and hours 
writing and drawing their very own 
comic books. 

Over the years, they had created 
hundreds of their own comics, starring 
dozens of their own superheroes. First 
there was “Dog Man,” then came “Timmy 
the Talking Toilet,” and who could forget 
“The Amazing Cow Lady”? 

But the all-time greatest superhero 
they ever made up had to be “The 
Amazing Captain Underpants.” 


George came up with the idea. 

“Most superheroes look like they’re 
flying around in their underwear,” he 
said. “Well, this guy actually is flying 
around in his underwear!” 

The two boys laughed and laughed. 
“Yeah,” said Harold, “he could fight 
with Wedgie PowerV 

George and Harold spent entire 
afternoons writing and drawing the comic 
adventures of Captain Underpants. He was 
their coolest superhero ever! 





Luckily for the boys, the secretary at 
Jerome Horwitz Elementary School was 
much too busy to keep an eye on the 
copy machine. So whenever they got a 
chance, Harold and George would sneak 
into the office and run off several hundred 
copies of their latest Captain Underpants 
adventure. 

After school, they sold their homemade 
comics on the playground for 50<t each.

CHAPTER 4 

MEAN OLD MR. KRUPP 



Now, Mr. Krupp was the meanest, 
sourest old principal in the whole history 
of Jerome Horwitz Elementary School. He 
hated laughter and singing. He hated the 
sounds of children playing at recess. In 
fact, he hated children altogether! 

And guess which two children Mr. 
Krupp hated most of all? 



If you guessed George and Harold, 
you’re right! Mr. Krupp hated George and 
Harold. 

He hated their pranks and their wise¬ 
cracks. He hated their silly attitudes and 
their constant giggling. And he especially 
hated those awful Captain Underpants 
comic books.

CHAPTEA 5 

OME DAY VEAYr 
VEAY SOON 


Remember when I said that George and 
Harold’s “silly streak” got them into big, 
BIG trouble once? Well, this is the story 
of how that happened. And how some 
huge pranks (and a little blackmail) 
turned their principal into the coolest 
superhero of all time. 

It was the day of the big football game 
between the Horwitz Knuckleheads and 
the Stubinville Stinkbugs. The bleachers 
were filled with fans. 




The cheerleaders ran onto the field and 
shook their pom-poms over their heads. 

A fine black dust drifted out of their 
pom-poms and settled all around them. 

“Gimme a K!” shouted the cheer¬ 
leaders. 

“K!” repeated the fans. 

“Gimme an N!” shouted the cheer¬ 
leaders. 

“N!” repeated the fans. 

“Gimme an . . . a-ah-ah-A-CHOO!” 
sneezed the cheerleaders. 

“A-ah-ah-A-CHOO!” repeated the fans. 












The cheerleaders sneezed and sneezed 
and sneezed some more. They couldn’t 
stop sneezing, 

“Hey!” shouted a fan in the bleachers, 
“Somebody sprinkled black pepper into 
the cheerleaders’ pom-poms!” 

“I wonder who did that?” asked 
another fan. 


27 




The cheerleaders stumbled off the field, 
sneezing and dripping with mucus, as 
the marching band members took their 
places. 

But when the band began to play, 
steady streams of bubbles began blowing 
out of their instruments! Bubbles were 
everywhere\ Up and down the field the 
marching band slipped and slid, leaving 
behind a thick trail of wet, bubbly foam. 

“Hey!” shouted a fan in the bleachers. 

“Somebody poured bubble bath into the 
marching band’s instruments!” « 


“I wonder who did that?” asked ' 

another fan. 





O 



Soon, the football teams took the field. 
The Knuckleheads kicked the ball. Up, up, 
up went the ball. Higher and higher it 
went. The ball sailed into the clouds 
and kept right on going until 
nobody could see it anymore. 

“Hey!” shouted a fan 
in the bleachers. 

“Somebody filled 
the game ball 
with helium ! 

“I wonder who 
did that?” asked 
another fan 



^ ot/o ^ 

O ® O o o o 

O 




But the missing ball didn’t make any 
difference because at that moment, the 
Knuckleheads were rolling around the 
field, scratching and itching like crazy. 

“Hey!” shouted the coach. “Somebody 
replaced our Deep-Heating Muscle Rub 
Lotion with Mr. Prankster’s Extra-Scratchy 
Itching Cream!” 

“We wonder who did that?!” shouted the 
fans in the bleachers. 


30 



The whole afternoon went on much 
the same way, with people shouting 
everything from “Hey, somebody put 
Sea-Monkeys in the lemonade!” to “Hey, 
somebody glued all the bathroom doors 
shut!” 

Before long, most of the fans in the 
bleachers had gotten up and left. The big 
game had been forfeited, and everyone in 
the entire school was miserable. 













Everyone, that is, except for two 
giggling boys crouching in the shadows 
beneath the bleachers. 

“Those were our best pranks yet!” 
laughed Harold. 

“Yep,” chuckled George, “they’ll be 
hard to top, that’s for sure.” 

“I just hope we don’t get busted for 
this,” said Harold. 

“Don’t worry,” said George. “We 
covered our tracks really well. There’s 
no way we’ll get busted!” 


32 



CHAPTER 6 

BUSTED 


The next day at school, an announcement 
came over the loudspeakers. 

“George Beard and Harold Hutchins, 
please report to Principal Krupp’s 
office at once.” 

“Uh-oh!” said Harold. ‘T don’t like the 
sound of thatV 

“Don’t worry,” said George. “They can’t 
prove anything!” 



George and Harold entered Principal 
Krupp’s office and sat down on the chairs 
in front of his desk. The two boys had 
been in this office together countless 
times before, but this time was different. 
Mr. Krupp was smiling. As long as George 
and Harold had known Mr. Krupp, they 
had never, ever seen him smile. Mr. Krupp 
knew something. 

‘T didn’t see you boys at the big game 
yesterday,” said Mr. Krupp. 

“Uh, no,” said George. “We weren’t 
feeling well.” 

‘T-Y-Yeah,” Harold stammered 
nervously. “W-W-We went home.” 


“Aw, that’s too bad,” said Principal 
Krupp. “You boys missed a good game.” 

George and Harold quickly glanced at 
each other, gulped, and tried hard not to 
look guilty. 

“Lucky for you, I have a videotape of 
the whole thing,” Mr. Krupp said. He 
turned on the television in the corner and 
pressed the play button on the VCR. 



A black-and-white image appeared on 
the TV screen. It was an overhead shot of 
George and Harold sprinkling pepper into 
the cheerleaders’ pom-poms. Next came a 
shot of George and Harold pouring liquid 
bubble bath into the marching band’s 
instruments. 

“How do you like the pre-game showT' 
asked Mr. Krupp with a devilish grin. 


36 




“You know,” he said, “ever since you 
boys came to this school, it’s been one 
prank after another. First you put dissected 
frogs in the Jell-O salad at the parent- 
teacher banquet. Then you made it snow in 
the cafeteria. Then you rigged all the inter¬ 
coms so they played “Weird Al” Yankovic 
songs full blast for six hours straight. 

“For four long years you two have 
been running amok in this school, and 
I’ve never been able to prove anything — 
until now!” 

Mr. Krupp held the videotape in his 
hand. “I took the liberty of installing tiny 
video surveillance cameras all around the 
school. I knew I’d catch you two in the 
act one day. I just didn’t know it would be 
so easyV 




CHAPTEA 7 

A LITTLE BLACKMAIL 


Mr. Krupp sat back in his chair and 
chuckled to himself for a long, long time. 
Finally, George got up the courage to 
speak. 

“W-What are you going to do with that 
tape?” he said. 

“I thought you’d never ask,” laughed 
Principal Krupp. 



39 




“I’ve thought long and hard about what 
to do with this tape,” Mr. Krupp said. “At 
first, I thought I’d send copies to your 
parents.” 

The boys swallowed hard and sank 
deeply into their chairs. 

“Then I thought I might send a copy 
to the school board,” Mr. Krupp continued. 
“I could get you both expelled for this!” 

The boys swallowed harder and sank 
deeper into their chairs. 

“Finally, I came to a decision,” Mr. 

Krupp concluded. “I think the football 
team would be very curious to find out just 
who was responsible for yesterday’s fiasco. 

I think I’ll send a copy to them!” 

George and Harold leaped out of their 
chairs and fell to their knees. 




“No!” cried George. “You can’t do that. 
They’ll kill us!” 

“Yeah,” begged Harold, “they’ll kill us 
every day for the rest of our lives!” 




George and Harold carefully looked 
over the list. 

“This . . . this is blackmail!” said George. 

“Call it what you like,” Principal Krupp 
snapped, “but if you two don’t follow that 
list exactly, then this tape becomes the 
property of the Horwitz Knuckleheads!” 



CHAPTEA 8 

CRIME AND PUNISHMENT 



At six o’clock the next morning, George 
and Harold dragged themselves out of bed, 
walked over to Mr. Krupp’s house, and 
began washing his car. 

Then, while Harold scrubbed the tires, 
George roamed around the yard pulling 
up all the weeds and crabgrass he could 
find. Afterward, they cleaned the gutters 
and washed all the windows on Mr. 

Krupp’s house. 


43 



At school, George and Harold sat up 
straight, listened carefully, and spoke only 
when spoken to. They didn’t tell jokes, 
they didn’t pull pranks—they didn’t even 
smile. 

Their teacher kept pinching herself. “I 
just know this is a dream,” she said. 





At lunch, the two boys vacuumed 
Mr. Krupp’s office, shined his shoes, 
and polished his desktop. At recess, they 
clipped his fingernails and ironed his tie. 

Each spare moment in the boys’ daily 
schedule was spent catering to Mr. 
Krupp’s every whim. 


45 


After school, George and Harold 
mowed Mr. Krupp’s lawn, tended his 
garden, and began painting the front 
of his house. At sunset, Mr. Krupp came 
outside and handed each boy a stack of 
books. 

“Gentlemen,” he said, “I’ve asked 
your teachers to give you both extra 
homework. Now go home, study hard, 
and I’ll see you back here at six o’clock 
tomorrow morning. We’ve got a busy 
day ahead of us.” 




“Thank you, sir,” moaned the two boys. 

George and Harold walked home dead 
tired. 

“Man, this was the worst day of my 
entire life,” said George. 

“Don’t worry,” said Harold. “We only 
have to do this for eight more years. Then 
we can move away to some far-off land 
where they’ll never find us. Maybe 
Antarctica.” 

“I’ve got a better idea,” said George. 











He took a piece of paper out of his 
pocket and handed it to Harold. It was an 
old magazine ad for the 3-D Hypno-Ring. 

“How’s this going to help us?” asked 
Harold. 

“All we gotta do is hypnotize Mr. 
Krupp,” said George. “We’ll make him 
give us the video and forget this whole 
mess ever happened.” 

“That’s a great idea!” said Harold. “And 
the best part is we only have to wait four- 
to-six weeks for delivery!” 


48 


CHAPTEA 9 

FOUIt-TO-SIX 
WEEKS LATEA 


After four-to-six weeks of backbreaking 
slave labor, grueling homework assign¬ 
ments, and humiliating good behavior 
at school, a package arrived in George’s 
mailbox from the Li’l Wiseguy Novelty 
Company. 

It was the 3-D Hypno-Ring. 




“Hallelujah!” cried George. “It’s every¬ 
thing 1 ever hoped for!” 

“Let me see, let me see,” said Harold. 
“Don’t look directly at it,” warned 
George. “You don’t want to get hypno¬ 
tized, do you?” 



“Do you really think it will work?” 
asked Harold. “Do you really think we can 
‘amaze our friends, control our enemies, 
and take over the world’ just like the ad 
says?” 

“It better work,” said George. “Or else 
we just wasted four whole bucks!” 


CHAPTER 10 

THE 3-D HYPHO-AIHG 


The next morning, George and Harold 
didn’t arrive early at Mr. Krupp’s house 
to wash his car and reshingle his roof. In 
fact, they were even a little late getting to 
school. 

When they finally showed up, Mr. 
Krupp was standing at the front door 
waiting for them. And boy, was he mad\ 



Mr. Krupp escorted the boys into his 
office and slammed the door. 

“All right, where were you two this 
morning?” he growled. 

“We wanted to come over to your 
house,” said George, “but we were busy 
trying to figure out the secret of this 
ring." 

“What ring?” snapped Mr. Krupp. 

George held up his hand and showed 
the ring to Principal Krupp. 

“It’s got one of those weird patterns on 
it,” said Harold. “If you stare at it long 
enough, a picture appears.” 

“Well, hold it still,” snarled Mr. Krupp. 
“I can’t see the darn thing!” 

“I have to move it back and forth,” said 
George, “or else it won’t work.” 


Mr. Krupp’s eyes followed the ring back 
and forth, back and forth, back and forth, 
and back and forth. 

“You have to stare deeper into the 
ring,” said Harold. “Deeper . . . deeeper . . . 
deeeeper . . . deeeeeeeeeper.” 

“You are getting sleepy,” said George. 
“Veeeeery sleeeeeeeeeepy.” 

Mr. Krupp’s eyelids began to droop, 
“rmmmsssoooosssleeepy,” he mumbled. 

After a few minutes, Mr. Krupp’s eyes 
were closed tight, and he began to snore. 

“You are under our spell,” said George. 
“When I snap my fingers, you will obey 
our every command!” 

Snap! 

“Iwwilllloobeyyy,” mumbled Mr. Krupp. 




“All right,” said George. “Have you still 
got that videotape of me and Harold?” 

“Yeeessss,” mumbled Mr. Krupp. 

“Well, hand it over, bub,” George 
instructed. 

Mr. Krupp unlocked a large file cabinet 
and opened the bottom drawer. He 
reached in and handed George the video¬ 
tape. George stuffed it into his backpack. 

Harold took a different video out of his 
backpack and put it into the file cabinet. 

“What’s that video?” asked George. 

“It’s one of my little sister’s old 
‘Boomer the Purple Dragon Sing-A-Long’ 
videos.” 

“Nice touch,” said George. 


54 




CHAPTCA II 

FUM I^ITH HYPNOSIS 


When Harold bent down to close the file 
cabinet, he took a quick look inside. 

“Whoa!” he cried. “Look at all the stuff 
in here!” 

The file cabinet was filled with every¬ 
thing Mr. Krupp had taken away from 
the boys over the years. There were sling¬ 
shots, whoopee cushions, skateboards, 
fake doggy doo-doo—you name it, it was 
in there. 

“Look at this!” cried George. “A big 
stack of Captain Underpants comics!” 

“He’s got every issue!” said Harold. 





For hours, the two boys sat on the 
floor laughing and reading their comics. 
Finally, George looked up at the clock. 

“Yikes!” he said. “It’s almost 
lunchtime! We better clean up this mess 
and get to class.” 

The boys looked up at their principal, 
who had been standing behind them in 
a trance all morning. 

“Gee, I almost forgot about Mr. 
Krupp,” said Harold. “What should we 
do with him?” 

“Do you want to have some fun?” 
asked George. 

“Why not?” said Harold. “I haven’t had 
any fun in the last four-to-six weeks!” 







“Cool,” said George. He walked up to 
Mr. Krupp and snapped his fingers. Snap! 
“You are—a chicken\” he said. 

Suddenly, Mr. Krupp leaped onto his 
desk and flapped his arms. “Cluck, cluck, 
cluck-cluck,” he cried, kicking his papers 
off the desk behind him and pecking at 
his pen-and-pencil set. 

George and Harold howled with 
laughter. 

“Let me try, let me try,” said Harold. 

“Ummm, you are a—a monkey V' 






“You gotta snap your fingers,” said 
George. 

“Oh, yeah,” said Harold. Snap! “You 
are a monkey V 

Suddenly, Mr. Krupp sprang off his 
desk and began swinging from the 
fluorescent light fixtures. “Ooo-ooo, ooo- 
oooo, OOOOO!” he shrieked, leaping from 
one side of the room to the other. 

George and Harold laughed so hard 
they almost cried. 


58 



“My turn, my turn!” said George. “Let’s 
see. What should we turn him into next?” 

“I know,” Harold said, holding up a 
Captain Underpants comic. “Let’s turn 
him into Captain Underpants!” 

“Good idea,” said George. Snap! “You 
are now the greatest superhero of all 
time: The Amazing Captain Underpants^ 
Mr. Krupp tore down the red curtain 
from his office window and tied it around 
his neck. Then he took off his shoes, 
socks, shirt, pants, and his awful toupee. 





“Tra-La-Laaaaaaaa!” he sang. 


Mr. Krupp stood before them looking 
quite triumphant, with his cape blowing 
in the breeze of the open window. George 
and Harold were dumbfounded. 

“You know,” said George, “he kinda 
looks like Captain Underpants.” 

“Yeah,” Harold replied. 

After a short silence, the two boys 
looked at each other and burst into 
laughter. George and Harold had never 
laughed so hard in all their lives. Tears 
ran down their faces as they rolled about 
the floor, shrieking in hysterics. 

After a while, George pulled himself up 
from the floor for another look. 

“Hey,” George cried. “Where’d he go?” 

60 



CHAPTER n 

OUT THE l¥IMDOI¥ 


George and Harold dashed to the window 
and looked out. There, running across the 
parking lot, was a pudgy old guy in his 
underwear with a red cape flowing 
behind him. 



“Mr. Krupp, come back!” shouted 
Harold. 

“He won’t answer to that,'" said 
George. “He thinks he’s Captain 
Underpants now.” 

“Oh, no,” said Harold. 

“He’s probably runnin’ off to fight 
crime,” said George. 

“Oh, no” said Harold. 

“And we gotta stop him,” said George. 

“Oh, NO,” cried Harold. “NO WAY!” 

“Look,” said George, “he could get 
killed out there.” 

Harold was unmoved. 

“Or worse,” said George. “We could get 
into BIG trouble!” 

“You’re right,” said Harold. “We gotta 
go after him!” 


The two boys opened the bottom 
file-cabinet drawer and took out their 
slingshots and skateboards. 

“Do you think we should bring any¬ 
thing else?” asked Harold. 

“Yeah,” said George. “Let’s bring the 
fake doggy doo-doo.” 

“Good thinking,” said Harold. “You 
just never know when fake doggy doo-doo 
is going to come in handy!” 




V ..2 


Harold stuffed Mr. Krupp’s clothes, 
shoes, and toupee into his backpack. 
Then together the two boys leaped out 
the window, slid down the flagpole, and 
took off on their skateboards after the 
Amazing Captain Underpants. 







CHAPTER IS 

BANK AOBBEAS 


George and Harold rode their skateboards 
all over town looking for Captain 
Underpants. 

“I can’t find him anywhere,” said 
Harold. 

“You’d think a guy like him would be 
easy to spot,” said George. 




Then the boys turned a corner, and 
there he was. Captain Underpants was 
standing in front of a bank, looking quite 
heroic. 

“Mr. Krupp!” cried Harold. 

“Shhh,” said George, “don’t call him 
that. Call him Captain Underpants!” 

“Oh, yeah,” said Harold. 

“And don’t forget to snap your fingers,” 
said George. 

“Right!” said Harold.

But before he got a chance, the bank 
doors flew wide open, and out stepped 
two robbers. The robbers took one look 
at Captain Underpants and stopped dead 
in their tracks. 


“Surrender!” said Captain Underpants. 
“Or I will have to resort to Wedgie PowerV' 



QQ 



Nobody moved for about ten seconds. 
Finally, the robbers looked at each other 
and burst out laughing. They dropped 
their loot and fell to the sidewalk scream¬ 
ing in hysterics. 









Almost immediately, the cops showed 
up and arrested the crooks. 

“Let that be a lesson to you,” cried 
Captain Underpants. “Never underestimate 
the power of underwear!” 

The police chief, looking quite angry, 
marched over to Captain Underpants. 

“And just who the heck are you 
supposed to be?” the police chief demanded. 

“Why, Vm Captain Underpants, the 
world’s greatest superhero,” said Captain 
Underpants. “I fight for Truth, Justice, and 
all that is Pre-Shrunk and Cottony!” 

“Oh, YEAHWT' shouted the police chief. 
“Cuff him, boys!” 

One of the cops took out his handcuffs 
and grabbed Captain Underpants by the arm. 


69 





“Uh-oh!” cried George. “We gotta roll!” 
Together the two boys zoomed into the 
crowd, weaving in and out of cops and 
bystanders. Harold skated up to Captain 
Underpants and knocked the superhero 
off his feet. George caught him and the 
boys skated away with Captain 
Underpants on their shoulders. 

“Stop!” cried the cops, but it was too 
late. George, Harold, and Captain 
Underpants were gone.

THE BIG BAHG 

After their quick escape, George, Harold, 
and Captain Underpants stopped on a 
deserted street corner to catch their 
breath, 

“OK,” said George. “Let’s de-hypnotize 
him quick, before something else . . . 






A huge explosion came from the Rare 
Crystal Shop across the street. Heavy 
smoke poured out of the building. 
Suddenly, two robots with one stolen 
crystal emerged from the smoke and 
jumped into an old van. 

“Did I Just see two ROBOTS get into a 
van?” asked Harold. 

“You know,” said George, “up until 
now this story was almost believable^ 


72 


“Well, believable or not,” said Harold, 
“we’re not getting involved. I repeat: We 
are NOT getting involved!” 

Just then. Captain Underpants leaped 
from the street corner and dashed in 
front of the van, 

“Stop, in the name of underwear!” he 
cried. 

“Uh-oh,” said George. “I think we’re 
involved." 

The two robots started up the van 
and swerved around Captain Underpants. 
Unfortunately, the van brushed up against 
his red cape, and it got caught. With a 
mighty jerk. Captain Underpants flipped 
backward, and the van pulled him along 
as it drove away. 








“GRAB HIM!” cried George. 

The two boys skateboarded with all 
their might toward the speeding van and 
grabbed Captain Underpants by the 
ankles. 

“HEEEEEEELLLLLLLP!” they cried 
as the van pulled them through the 





“Mommy,” said a little boy sitting on 
a bench, “I just saw two robots driving a 
van with a guy in his underwear hanging 
off the back by a red cape, pulling two 
boys on skateboards behind him with his 
feet.” 

“How do you expect me to believe such 
a ridiculous story?” asked his mother. 




Finally, the van came to a screeching 
halt in front of an old abandoned ware¬ 
house. The sudden stop made Captain 
Underpants flip over the roof of the van 
and crash through the front door of the 
building. 

“Well, well, well,” said a strange voice 
from inside the warehouse. “It looks as if 
we have a visitor." 



CHAPTEA 15 

DA. DIAPEA 


George and Harold hid behind the van 
until the coast was clear. Then they 
sneaked up to the hole in the door and 
peeked inside. 

Captain Underpants was all tied up, 
the two robots were standing guard, and 
a strange little man wearing a diaper was 
laughing maniacally. 





“I am the evil Dr. Diaper,” the strange 
little man told Captain Underpants. “And 
you will be the first to witness my 
takeover of the worldV' 

Dr. Diaper placed the stolen crystal 
into a large machine called the Laser- 
Matic 2000. The machine started to light 
up and make loud noises. Heavy gears 
began shifting and spinning, and a laser 
beam from the crystal shot straight up 
through a hole in the roof. 








“In exactly twenty minutes, this laser 
beam will blow up the moon and send 
huge chunks of it crashing down upon 
every major city in the world!” laughed 
Dr. Diaper. “Then, I will rise from the 
rubble and take over the planet!” 

“Only one thing can help us now,” said 
George. 

“What?” asked Harold. 

“Rubber doggy doo-doo,” said George. 




Harold took the fake doggy doo-doo 
and a slingshot from George’s backpack 
and handed them to him. 

“Be careful,” said Harold. “The fate of 
the entire planet is in your hands!” 

With careful and precise aim, George 
shot the rubber doo-doo through the air 
and across the room. It landed with a 
plop\ — right at the feet of Dr. Diaper. 

‘Tessss!” whispered George and 
Harold. 




Dr. Diaper looked down at the doo-doo 
between his feet and turned bright red. 

“Oh, dear me!” he cried. “Fm dreadfully 
embarrassed! Please excuse me.” 

He began to waddle toward the rest¬ 
room. “This has never happened to me 
before, I assure you,” he said. “I-I guess 
with all the excitement, I just... I just. . . 
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” 


81 



While Dr. Diaper was off changing 
himself, George and Harold sneaked into 
the old warehouse. 

Immediately, the robots detected the 
boys and began marching toward them. 
“Destroy the intruders!” said the robots. 
“Destroy the intruders!” 

George and Harold screamed and ran 
to the back of the warehouse. Luckily, 
George found two old boards and gave 
one of them to Harold. 

“We’re not going to have to resort to 
extremely graphic violence, are we?” 
asked Harold. 

“I sure hope not,” said George.

THE ESCAPE 


After defeating the robots, George and H 

Harold untied Captain Underpants. V 

“Come on!” cried Harold. “Let’s get out A 
of here!” y 

“Wait!” said Captain Underpants. “We k 

have to save the world first!” r 

So George, Harold, and Captain a 

Underpants frantically looked all over the y 
Laser-Matic 2000, searching for a way \ 

to shut it down and stop the inevitable L/l \ 
disaster. ^

“Ummm,” said Harold. “I think this 
might be the lever we want.” 

He pulled the “Self-Destruct” lever 
with all his might. Suddenly, the Laser- 
Matic 2000 began to sputter and shake. 
The huge laser beam turned off, and 
pieces of the machine began flying off in 
all directions. 

“It’s gonna BLOW!” cried Harold. 
“RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!”

wor so FAST/” screamed Dr. Diaper, 
who had appeared out of nowhere. “You 
demolished my robots. You destroyed my 
Laser-Matic 2000. And you ruined my one 
chance to take over the world—but you 
won’t live to tell the tale!” Dr. Diaper 
pulled out his Diaper-Matic 2000 ray gun, 
and pointed it at George, Harold, and 
Captain Underpants. 




Captain Underpants quickly stretched 
a pair of underwear and shot it at Dr. 
Diaper. The underwear landed right on 
the evil doctor’s head. 

“Help!” cried Dr. Diaper. “I can’t see! 

I can’t see!” 




George and Harold ran out of the 
warehouse as fast as they could. 

“Great shot. Captain Underpants!” 
cried Harold. 

“There’s just one thing 1 don’t under¬ 
stand,” said George. “Where’d you get the 
extra pair of underwear?” 







“Never mind that,” cried George, “let’s 
just get out of here before that Laser- 
Matic 2000 thing ex . . . 





The Laser-Matic 2000 blew up, tearing 
apart the old warehouse. It sent flaming 
shards of red-hot metal in every direction. 
Fire fell from the skies around our 
heroes, and the earth began to crumble 
beneath their feet. 

“Oh, NO!” cried Harold. “WE’RE 
^ DOOMED!”

George, Harold, and Captain Underpants 
made a quick stop outside the police 
station. They tied Dr. Diaper to a lamppost 
and attached a note to him. 

“There!” said Captain Underpants. 

“That ought to explain everything.”

Then George and Harold led Captain 
Underpants back to Jerome Horwitz 
Elementary School. 

“Why are we going hereT' asked 
Captain Underpants. 

“Well,” said George, “you have to do 
some undercover work here.” 

‘Teah,” said Harold, reaching into his 
backpack. “Put these clothes on, and 
make it snappy!” 

“Don’t forget your hair,” said George. 





Captain Underpants quickly got 
dressed behind some bushes. “Well, how 
do I look?” he asked. 

“Pretty good,” said George. “Now try 
to look really mad!” 

Captain Underpants made the nastiest 
face he could. 

“You know,” said Harold, “he kinda 
looks like Mr. Krupp!” 

''Harold,'' whispered George, “he is 
Mr. Krupp!” 

“Oh, yeah,” said Harold. “I almost 
forgot.” 


107 




Before long, they were all back inside 
Mr. Krupp’s office. 

“OK, Captain Underpants,” said 
George, “you are now Mr. Krupp.” 

“Snap your fingers,” whispered Harold. 

“Oh, yeah,” said George. Snap! “You 
are now Mr. Krupp.” 

“Who’s Mr. Krupp?” asked Captain 
Underpants. 

“Oh, NO!” cried Harold. “It's not 
working!” 

The boys tried again and again to 
de-hypnotize Captain Underpants, but 
nothing seemed to work. 


108 



“Hmmm,” said Harold. “Let me see 
the instruction manual for that ring.” 

George checked his pants pockets. 

“Umm,” said George, “I think I lost it. 

“You WHAT?” cried Harold. The two 
boys searched frantically through the 
office, but the 3-D Hypno-Ring instruc¬ 
tion manual was nowhere to be found. 

“Never mind,” said George. “I have an 
idea.” He removed the flowers from a 
large vase in the corner. Then he poured 
out all of the water over Captain 
Underpants’s head. 

“What did you do that for?” cried 
Harold. 

“I saw ’em do this in a cartoon once,” 
said George, “so it’s gotta work!” 



After a few minutes, Mr. Krupp slowly 
came to. “What’s going on here?” he 
demanded. “And why am I all wet!!?” 

George and Harold had never been so 
glad to see Mr. Krupp in all their lives. 

“I’m so happy I could cry,” said Harold. 

“Well, you’re gonna cry when I give 
that videotape to the football team!” 
shouted Mr. Krupp. “I’ve had it with you 


two!” 






Principal Krupp took the videotape 
out of his file cabinet. “You boys are dead 
meatV he sneered. He stormed out of his 
office with the video and headed toward 
the gym. 

George and Harold smiled. “Wait’ll the 
football team sees that video!” said 
Harold. 

‘Teah,” said George, “I sure hope they 
like singing purple dragons!” 


Ill 



“Hey, look,” said George. “I found the 
3-D Hypno-Ring instruction manual. It 
was in my shirt pocket, not my pants 
pocket!” 

“Well, throw that thing away,” said 
Harold. “We’ll never need it again.” 

“I sure hope not,” said George.

Things at Jerome Horwitz Elementary 
School were never quite the same after 
that fateful day. 

The football team enjoyed Mr. Krupp’s 
video so much that they changed their 
name from the Knuckleheads to the 
Purple Dragon Sing-A-Long Friends. The 
name change didn’t go over too well with 
the fans, but hey, who’s going to argue 
with a bunch of linebackers?

George and Harold went back to their 
old ways, pulling pranks, cracking jokes, 
and making new comic books. 

They had to keep an eye on Mr. Krupp, 
though . . .
